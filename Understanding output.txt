Based on the topic modeling results you've provided, here's how I would map the topics to the components in the architectural blueprint, considering the key terms associated with each topic:

Topic 0:
Keywords: "want", "user", "agency", "broker", "data", "error", "submission", "ensure", "developer", "fabs"

Associated Component: Component_0 (Authentication)

This topic seems to be about user authentication and submissions, where terms like "user", "agency", "broker", and "submission" suggest user-related actions and the need for ensuring valid actions (possibly an authentication flow or form submission).

Topic 1:
Keywords: "want", "ui", "know", "designer", "approvals", "move", "edits", "leadership", "round", "get"

Associated Component: Component_1 (Admin Controls)

This topic focuses on UI and design elements, such as "ui", "designer", "approvals", and "edits", which likely relate to the admin's ability to manage and approve user interfaces or system controls.

Topic 2:
Keywords: "want", "developer", "fabs", "fpds", "published", "validation", "data", "new", "time", "reasonable"

Associated Component: Component_2 (User Access & DevOps Functions)

This topic includes terms like "developer", "published", "validation", and "data", which align with user access management, backend validation, and DevOps tasks. These concepts are closely related to system infrastructure and user access functionalities.

Topic 3:
Keywords: "want", "broker", "team", "member", "ensure", "designer", "fabs", "ui", "user", "updates"

Associated Component: Component_2 (User Access & DevOps Functions)

This topic touches on team collaboration, design elements, and updates, which are more closely related to DevOps functions and ensuring user access control or interface updates.

Topic 4:
Keywords: "want", "user", "fabs", "data", "agency", "historical", "fpds", "access", "see", "accept"

Associated Component: Component_0 (Authentication)

This topic centers around user-related actions like "user", "data", and "access", along with terms that could involve the authentication and access control flow, specifically for users to interact with the system.

Summary Mapping:
Component_0 (Authentication): Topics 0 and 4

Component_1 (Admin Controls): Topic 1

Component_2 (User Access & DevOps Functions): Topics 2 and 3

This mapping aligns topics with the respective components based on the terms and actions related to each component's functionality.
